# Minesweeper-Bot
A python program created by me to solve the Minesweeper game.

Requirements:
  -Python
Required modules:   (to download them run the followings on the terminal)
  -openCV           (pip install opencv-python)
  -pyautogui        (pip install  pyautogui)
  -numpy            (pip install numpy)
  
The program is designed for the classic look of minesweeper found at http://minesweeperonline.com

In the program you need to change the png images' locations to your's.

It is recomended to play with the game zoomed at 200% on the left hand side of the screen.

Also it is not sure that the program will win 100% of the time as when theres a 50/50 chance it does
nothing so as not to lose.

When you run it you will see a preview of what the computer "sees" so you can adjust the screen.

To know that everything is going ok the preview should have the game board with red squares 
around ALL unknown boxes.
