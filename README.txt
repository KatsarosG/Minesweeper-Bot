# Minesweeper-Bot
A python program created by me to solve the Minesweeper game.

Requirements:
  -Python
Required modules:   (to download them run the followings on the terminal)
  -openCV           (pip install opencv-python)
  -pyautogui        (pip install  pyautogui)
  -numpy            (pip install numpy)
  
The program is designed for the classic look of minesweeper found at http://minesweeperonline.com

It is recomended to play with the game zoomed at 200% on the left hand side of the screen.

Also it is not sure that the program will win 100% of the time as when theres a 50/50 chance it does
nothing so as not to lose.
